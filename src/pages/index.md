      - title: Adobe Premiere Pro
        content: >-
          Used for all my video editing tasks. Like it for producing broadcast-quality and high-definition video. Also rely on it for importing video, audio and graphics as well as creating new edited versions of video which can be exported to other mediums and formats.
      - title: Adobe Photoshop
        content: >-
          Enables me to edit and compose raster images in multiple layers. My favourite feature is the plug-ins facility where the app can be expanded to offer new or enhanced features.
      - title: Adobe After Effects
        content: >-
          The post-production process would not be an enjoyable one without After Effects. It''s my go to tool for digital visual effects and motion graphics. I sometimes use it as a very basic non-linear editor, audio editor, and media transcoder.
      - title: Adobe Illustrator
        content: >-
          For my vector artwork, nothing comes close to Illustrator. The latest version has improved color and font handling as well as program settings syncing. Saving documents to the cloud and integration with Behance is a major plus for me too.
